# Volnux Overview

Volnux is an event-driven workflow orchestration platform that enables you to build, manage, and visualize complex workflows triggered by events in your system.

## What is Volnux?

Volnux simplifies event-driven architecture by providing a centralized platform to:

1. **Define Workflows** - Create multi-step workflows using a visual builder
2. **Handle Events** - Process events from various sources in real-time
3. **Manage State** - Track workflow execution and event processing
4. **Monitor Performance** - Get insights into your workflow executions

## Core Concepts

### Events
Events are signals that trigger your workflows. They can come from:
- System events (application updates, user actions)
- External integrations (webhooks, APIs)
- Scheduled triggers (time-based events)

### Workflows
Workflows are sequences of actions executed in response to events. Each workflow:
- Has a trigger (what starts it)
- Contains multiple actions (what it does)
- Produces outputs (results)

### Triggers
Triggers define when a workflow should execute:
- Event-based triggers
- Time-based triggers
- Manual triggers

### Actions
Actions are individual steps within a workflow:
- Data transformation
- API calls
- Notifications
- Database operations

### Event Pipelines
Event pipelines chain multiple steps of event processing together:
- Receive events
- Transform data
- Route to appropriate handlers
- Execute workflows

## Why Use Volnux?

- **Simplified Event Management** - Handle complex event flows with ease
- **Visual Design** - Build workflows without writing code
- **Real-Time Processing** - Process events as they happen
- **Scalable** - Handle high-volume event streams
- **Extensible** - Add custom integrations via plugins
- **Open Source** - Full transparency and community-driven development

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic understanding of event-driven architecture
- A code editor of your choice
